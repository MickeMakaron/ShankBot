# ShankBot

## Build
1. Download source
    > git clone https://github.com/MickeMakaron/ShankBot
		
2. Install dependencies:
	* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/#section-2). Only the QtCore and QtGui binaries and headers are actually used by ShankBot. If you don't want all the bloat that comes with a Qt installation you could build those binaries yourself. It's easier to just use their installer, though.
	* [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/). Only the headers are needed.
		
3. Build with CMake. You will be prompted to tell CMake where you installed the dependencies in the previous step.
